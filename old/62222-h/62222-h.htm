<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Vicar</span>,</p>
<p>Will you permit me to address to you, and through you to
others, some remarks upon the subject of the Restoration of our
Parish Church.</p>
<p>Such a request needs I think no apology.&nbsp; As a
parishioner I cannot be indifferent to such a question.&nbsp; As
an architect, whose attention has been directed professionally to
the subject for more than two years, I may fairly ask a
hearing.&nbsp; Did I need a further excuse the address at the
head of this letter would supply it.&nbsp; Living as I do, and,
please God, shall do for many years, almost under the shade of
the Parish Church, and having it before my eyes continually, I
have every opportunity of coming to a clear opinion upon the
matter, and every motive to form a sound one.</p>
<p>The movement of public opinion which issued in the invitation
to certain architects to submit in competition designs for the
restoration of the building had two sources.</p>
<p>The existing arrangements of the church are not in accordance
with the improved ecclesiastical taste of the present day.&nbsp;
The high pews which encumber the interior, the galleries which
disfigure its really fine proportions, the cramped space about
the holy table, the unsightly reading desk, the absence of any
proper chancel, and of any conveniences for a well-conducted
choir, shock the taste and offend the judgment of all
well-informed churchmen.&nbsp; It is probable however that this
feeling would have failed to produce a general <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>movement in
favour of restoration had it not been aided by a fact, the force
of which was apparent to every one.&nbsp; I allude of course to
the settlement of the Tower which had become serious as early as
1829.</p>
<p>In that year Messrs. Vulliamy, Hardwick &amp; Good were called
in to report upon the state of the Tower.&nbsp; Other reports
were made in 1861, 1864, 1866 and 1868.&nbsp; The cracks which
the subsidence of the Tower caused in those parts of the church
which abut upon it, occasioned naturally considerable alarm, and
the opinion became general that before long it would be necessary
to take down the Tower to avoid a catastrophe.</p>
<p>The scheme proposed early in 1872, for the &ldquo;alteration
and possibly enlargement of the Parish Church,&rdquo; was the
result of these two distinct impulses.</p>
<p>The course which was adopted reflects great credit upon the
Trustees.&nbsp; Instead of resorting to an open competition,
three architects were invited to send in designs, and a proper
remuneration was offered for the services of the unsuccessful
competitors.&nbsp; The Trustees deserve the thanks of the
profession and of the public for so straightforward and
honourable a course.&nbsp; The scheme submitted to the competing
architects involved three conditions: first, the need of
improvement in the arrangements of the church; secondly, the
necessity of taking down the Tower, assumed to be in a dangerous
state; and thirdly, a limit of expenditure fixed at
&pound;6500.&nbsp; For this sum it was required that a new Tower
and spire should be erected, and a proper chancel be added to the
existing nave terminating in an apse.</p>
<p>I cannot forbear in passing to remark upon the good taste
shown in the suggestion, contained in the instructions to the
architects, that the new tower should occupy a central position
over the new chancel.&nbsp; Such a proposal shows a sound
appreciation of the capabilities of the existing church and a
regard for its surroundings, which augurs well for the future of
the building.&nbsp; I am astonished to find that one of the
competitors should have disregarded so judicious a
suggestion.</p>
<p>I propose now to examine the three conditions which, as I have
said, are assumed in the scheme of the trustees, and I shall
endeavour <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>to
show that one of them is unfounded, and that two of them are
mutually inconsistent.</p>
<p>Of the necessity for an improvement in the arrangements of the
church no one can be more thoroughly convinced than myself.&nbsp;
In spite of the care with which the services have been for many
years conducted, the attendance at our Parish Church has always
been a duty rather than a pleasure.&nbsp; The inconvenience of
the principal entrances to the church, placed as they are close
to the very communion rails; the extreme difficulty of kneeling
in the high and narrow pews in which seat-holders are now
impounded; the position of the choir in the western gallery, in
rear, instead of in face, of the congregation; the lofty reading
desk, from which the prayers seem to be preached rather than
prayed; the cramped space about the holy table by which the
celebration of the Communion is rendered most inconvenient; the
galleries which disfigure the interior, and destroy the sense of
the oneness of the whole congregation; these and other defects
are too obvious to need enforcing here.&nbsp; The Trustees have
wisely recognised their existence and their scheme is a proposal
to remove them.&nbsp; In this every member of the congregation
will heartily support them.</p>
<p>It is to the second point involved in their proposals that I
wish to draw the attention of the parishioners&mdash;the assumed
dangerous condition of the Tower.</p>
<p>The Tower was erected with the church about a century and a
quarter ago, and is not only of very good proportions but is
remarkably well built.&nbsp; There is not a symptom of failure in
it from top to bottom.&nbsp; Careful and repeated examinations of
it have convinced me that it is as sound as a bell throughout,
and that at the present time it is in every respect in as good
condition as when it was first completed.&nbsp; Any person who
takes the trouble to examine the building may see for himself
that the cracks, which appear in the eastern part of the church,
are not in the Tower itself, but only in the walls that abut upon
it.&nbsp; They are simply the result of the greater weight of the
Tower, which has caused it to subside to a certain extent, and so
to crack the walls of the church, and of the staircases, which
being lighter, have undergone no settlement.</p>
<p>The Tower has settled, but it has done so in one block.&nbsp;
No <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>better
proof could be given of the excellent workmanship and capital
condition of the tower, than the fact that its subsidence has
caused no fracture whatever, in the fabric of the tower
itself.&nbsp; The settlement is due to an exceptional cause, the
decay of the planking on which its foundation are laid, but every
old tower in the country has undergone similar movement from
analogous causes.&nbsp; These movements may not be so obvious to
the unprofessional eye because, having generally occurred within
a century or so of the erection of the towers, the cracks which
they caused have long since been made good.&nbsp; Subsidences of
this kind come to an end after a certain time, the foundations
take a solid bearing and no further movement from this cause can
then arise.&nbsp; The great tower of St. Nicholas church in
Hamburg, upon the erection of which my father has been engaged
for twenty years, though it is not yet completed, and though it
stands upon one of the finest masses of concrete ever put in, has
already subsided more than six inches.&nbsp; Our Hampstead tower
has gone down something less than three inches.&nbsp; I need
scarcely say that it is not proposed to pull down the tower of
St. Nicholas on account of its six inches subsidence.&nbsp; Why
then should our Hampstead church be condemned.</p>
<p>The Tower is of excellent proportion and outline.&nbsp; It is
a very interesting and characteristic example of its date, and
forms with the adjacent buildings in Church Row an almost unique
group of 18th century architecture, of the greatest interest not
only to the architect and the artist, but also to every person of
taste and discrimination.&nbsp; No reason exists for its removal
which would not condemn to destruction half the old churches in
the country.&nbsp; To pull it down would be an act of needless
vandalism.&nbsp; It is associated with the earliest recollections
of those who, like myself, have known Hampstead from their
childhood, and it is the one public building of any antiquity
which our township possesses.&nbsp; To do away with it is to
destroy a piece of good work which, if left to itself, will
endure for centuries, and to incur the perfectly needless and
heavy expense of erecting a new tower.</p>
<p>The cause of the settlement of the Tower is, as I have stated,
the decay of the timber planking upon which its foundations are
laid.&nbsp; This has taken place to a greater extent upon the
west side than <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>upon the east.&nbsp; The consequence of this has been to
give the Tower a slight inclination westward.&nbsp; In 1868, Mr.
Hesketh and my father were instructed by the Trustees to examine
the foundations.&nbsp; They found that the planking had entirely
perished upon the western side, and that the foundations in this
part rested upon the natural soil, which is a compact loam.&nbsp;
Upon the eastern side a thickness of 2&frac12; inches of planking
still remained, only partially decayed.&nbsp; The report which
the architects made at that time stated, that it was probable
that the planking under the eastern side would gradually perish,
and that as this took place the Tower would settle down upon the
eastern side until it rested upon the loam.&nbsp; The
perpendicular position would thus be gradually restored, and no
further movement would then occur.&nbsp; I have recently plumbed
the Tower myself, and I find that this conjecture is borne out by
the result of my measurements.&nbsp; The inclination of the Tower
westward has <i>decreased</i> from seven inches in 1868 to from
four to five inches at the present time, thus affording a proof
of the soundness of the conclusion arrived at by Mr. Heskett and
my father six years ago.&nbsp; I give in a tabular form the
results of the observations made upon the Tower at different
dates, by which it will be seen that the inclination of the Tower
has decreased steadily since 1829. <a name="citation7"></a><a

<p>It will appear from this that from 1&frac14;&Prime; to
1&#8539;&Prime; thickness of planking remains still undecayed
under the eastern foundations.&nbsp; At the present rate of
movement, therefore, the decay will be complete in about <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>six years
time.&nbsp; The Tower will then have resumed its perpendicular
position, and no further settlement need be anticipated.&nbsp;
Even at the present time the inclination is less than the amount
of the set-off of the Tower, without taking into account the
spreading of the foundations.&nbsp; The top of the Tower,
therefore, stands well within its base, and the apprehension of
any sort of danger is absolutely unfounded.</p>
<p>There exists, therefore, no excuse whatever for destroying our
Tower.</p>
<p>The second point to which I wish to draw attention is the
important one of expense.</p>
<p>The proposals of the Trustees are quite inconsistent with the
limit of expenditure which they have fixed.</p>
<p>The scheme which has been put forward includes not only a new
Tower, but also a new chancel, terminating in an apse,&mdash;the
addition of transepts&mdash;the removal or extensive modification
of the galleries&mdash;the erection of new staircases, and
convenient vestries for clergy and choir&mdash;the construction
of proper covered approaches&mdash;the reseating of the whole of
the church&mdash;the decoration of the interior, and a
re-arrangement of the warming and gas-lighting.&nbsp; To suppose
that this grand scheme can be carried out for &pound;6500,
&ldquo;including professional and other charges,&rdquo; at the
present price of work in the building trades is simply
absurd.&nbsp; It reminds one of a story told of the late Mr.
Pugin.&nbsp; A Roman Catholic Bishop is said to have written to
the architect, ordering designs for a cathedral complete in every
respect, and furnished with all the necessary paraphernalia of
worship, which the bishop was careful to particularise.&nbsp; The
total cost was not to exceed two thousand pounds, but the bishop
stated that he did not expect the completion of the two western
towers to be included in this amount.&nbsp; Mr. Pugin&rsquo;s
reply was to this effect, &ldquo;My dear Lord Bishop,&mdash;Make
it guineas and have the towers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The present proposal
is almost as absurd to anyone who knows the price of building
work at the present time.&nbsp; If a perfectly substantial tower
is to be destroyed it will be an absolute duty to replace it by
one of higher character, and larger proportions, the cost of
which could not fall short of &pound;4000, and would probably
reach a much higher figure.&nbsp; To carry out properly the
scheme of the <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Trustees, a sum would be required which would be nearer
&pound;12,000 than &pound;6000.</p>
<p>Is it fair to saddle the Parish with such an expenditure, the
greater part of which is entirely needless?&nbsp; For the really
necessary alterations of our church, the funds which the Trustees
have at their disposal will suffice, if judiciously laid
out.&nbsp; Should more be really needed, the parishioners will
not be backward in supporting so good a work.&nbsp; But it seems
very unfair to us, to force upon us a scheme, which involves a
perfectly unnecessary outlay, a very large proportion of which
will have to be met by the voluntary contributions of the
parishioners.&nbsp; What is really required we shall all, I am
sure, be willing to contribute to, but we ought not to be asked
to provide large sums to carry out works which are quite
unnecessary, and which those of us, whose knowledge and taste
give them a right to an opinion, would sincerely deplore.</p>
<p>Were our Tower an old Gothic one, even of the least
interesting date, the proposal to sweep it away would be scouted
at once as utter barbarism.&nbsp; Those whose attention is
directed to architecture and art know very well, that such work
as the last two centuries produced, has an interest and a value
only second to that of the earlier styles.&nbsp; There is a great
movement of artistic feeling in favour of the architecture of the
reigns of Queen Anne and the earlier Georges, and it would be
quite intolerable that our Parish, which is so full of the
associations of that period, and the home of so many artists and
men of taste, should distinguish itself by an act of stupidity
which would really be quite behind the age.</p>
<p>It is common enough to hear people say &ldquo;how ugly the
Parish Church is,&rdquo; &ldquo;what frightful windows,&rdquo;
&ldquo;how unecclesiastical,&rdquo; &ldquo;just like a
meeting-house,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; To combat the
prejudices of mere ignorance is always a difficult task, and such
views are in reality nothing else.&nbsp; They are the opinions of
average common-place, rendered plausible only by constant
repetition.&nbsp; The only portion of the church which can fairly
be called ugly, is the exterior of the western transept, erected
within our own memory.&nbsp; The rest of the exterior is plain,
only because the architect, having a limited sum at his command,
wisely determined to spend the greatest portion of it upon his
interior.&nbsp; There would be no difficulty in embellishing <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>the exterior
with suitable architectural enrichments, if it be desired, and I
think that some improvement might be effected in the parapet of
the tower.&nbsp; But the interior is really stately, and a person
who does not see how vastly superior its effect is, to that of
the generality of our new churches in dignity and refinement,
must be singularly deficient in artistic discrimination.&nbsp;
The notion that a church must necessarily be Gothic, is a mere
caricature of that reasonable admiration for medi&aelig;val work,
which is felt by all men of taste.&nbsp; It is only a shallow
mind which, because it prefers Westminster Abbey, is blind to the
merits of St. Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I yield to no one in my love of
medi&aelig;val art, but I recognise the merits of the really good
work of all schools, and I simply cannot understand the dull and
stupid prejudice which could propose to destroy an interesting
and dignified building, and &ldquo;to do away with an historical
and artistic landmark, in order to substitute for it a church
which would be undistinguishable from the crowd of common-place
which this century is producing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have so great confidence in the sound sense of the Trustees,
and in the affection of Hampstead people for the associations of
our old Parish Church, that I feel sure it only needs that the
facts should be put clearly before them, to ensure the adoption
of a judiciously conservative course.</p>
<p>There is one simple and sufficiently obvious plan by which the
requirements of the case may be satisfactorily met.&nbsp; It is
most desirable to secure a properly arranged chancel.&nbsp; To do
this without loss of accommodation the church must be enlarged,
but instead of adding to it toward the east, involving, as this
does, the destruction of the Tower, and the costly expenditure of
erecting a new one, the obvious thing is to extend it
westward.</p>
<p>There is ample space for such an enlargement, and there are at
least two modes in which this may well be carried out.</p>
<p>The simplest is to remove the galleries, or at least a portion
of them, and to form a chancel by screening off the two eastern
bays of the present nave, or even three if desired.&nbsp; Many of
our finest ancient churches has their chancels arranged upon this
system.&nbsp; I may mention, as well known examples, the churches
of Grantham and Newark, and the noble church of St. Michael at
Coventry.</p>
<p>To provide for the loss of accommodation involved in the
removal <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>of
the galleries and the formation of a proper chancel, the nave
should be extended westward.&nbsp; It will be found that the
addition of a second western transept of the same size as the
present one would give the required number of seats, and if
thought desirable, a western aisle, or narthex, might be added
beyond the new transept, giving an opportunity for a Baptistry in
its correct position, and of effective design.</p>
<p>This plan has the great advantage of interfering to the
smallest possible extent with existing graves.&nbsp; A certain
portion of the ground required for this extension is already
occupied by a terrace, and the fall of the ground is such, that
the whole of the new work might be built on arches, or upon
vaults enclosing the few interments which occur in that part of
the church-yard.&nbsp; If more room be required, the existing
transept might be extended some 10 feet, north and south, without
any interference with graves, and the new building would be
widened by the same amount.</p>
<p>This question of graves seems to me of the utmost importance,
and it has not, apparently received the attention which it
deserves.&nbsp; This consideration, by itself, is fatal to the
plan of an eastward extension of the church, the ground to the
east of the building being perfectly full of interments.</p>
<p>I have said that it might be necessary to retain a portion at
least of the existing galleries.&nbsp; I confess I should greatly
deplore this necessity, and I doubt whether it really exists.</p>
<p>The population of the district attached to the Parish Church
is about 7500.&nbsp; The accommodation of the present church is
nominally 1600, and this was the number which the competing
architects were directed to provide for in their plans.&nbsp; The
actual accommodation of the church is, however, very much below
this figure, and I do not believe that it ever really seats more
than from 1200 to 1300.&nbsp; Such a number at any rate is amply
sufficient for the needs of the district, and this number could
easily be provided for by the plan of extension which I have
suggested, without any galleries whatever.&nbsp; I need scarcely
insist upon the great advantage to the proportions of the
building and to the comfort of the congregation, which would be
secured by the removal of all the galleries.</p>
<p>Such a scheme as I have indicated may be carried out
thoroughly <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>well for the sum which the Trustees have at their
disposal, and there would still be a margin left for such
decorations and improvements as are needed in the body of the
existing church.&nbsp; Should funds be unexpectedly forthcoming
for the erection of a really handsome tower, no finer position
could be desired, than the centre of the west front of the
addition which I have proposed.&nbsp; The fall of the ground
would give extraordinary dignity to a tower so placed.&nbsp; It
would have a most striking effect from Frognal, and the view of
it on approaching Hampstead from the west, seen, as it would be,
in conjunction with the existing eastern tower, would be
something quite unusually fine.&nbsp; Anyone possessing the sense
of architectural effect, will see at once the great dignity and
picturesqueness of such a group.&nbsp; A tower worthy of such a
position is no doubt beyond the means of the Trustees, but it
would afford a fine opportunity for the private munificence of
some one or more of our wealthy parishioners.</p>
<p>If precedents be desired for such an arrangement of two
towers, they will be found in Ely Cathedral, at Swaffham, and at
Fakenham.&nbsp; I may add that the organ would be placed in one
of the aisles immediately behind the choir seats.</p>
<p>This plan it will be observed utilises the <i>whole</i> of the
existing building, whereas that which has received the approval
of the Trustees retains little of it beside the modern western
transept.</p>
<p>If those who are anxious for proper chancel arrangements
should be dissatisfied with a Quire marked off by screens, there
is another mode of extending the Church, by which a
constructional chancel and the fashionable apse may be
obtained.&nbsp; I am, so far, however, from sympathising with
this feeling, that in large town churches I distinctly prefer
what may be termed the Basilican arrangement.&nbsp; I consider
that a chancel distinguished by a proper number of steps and by
screens behind the stalls, is far preferable, in a town church,
to one formed in the construction of the building, involving as
this does massive piers, obstructive to sight and sound.&nbsp;
With a chancel constructed as the Trustees propose, the great
majority of persons seated in the aisles will see little or
nothing of the choir.&nbsp; I consider this a very serious
defect.&nbsp; If the congregation is to sing with the choir, as
we all desire, it is of the greatest importance that we should be
able to see as well as hear.&nbsp; For the real uses of a modern
church <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>the
interior cannot be too unobstructed, and it seems to me a
retrograde movement to attempt to convert a church, which, but
for the galleries, is singularly open and thoroughly
congregational, into one in which at least one third of the
people would not see nearly so well as they do at present.</p>
<p>Should, however, the opposite view unfortunately prevail, and
a &ldquo;constructional chancel&rdquo; and an &ldquo;apsidal
termination&rdquo; be decided on, there is no difficulty at all
in providing for them upon the principle of a westward
extension.</p>
<p>I should propose in this case simply to reverse the church,
and to place the new chancel and apse at the west end.&nbsp; The
tower would thus remain as it is, but I should advise that a
central entrance should be formed through it, where the present
vestry is.&nbsp; A second tower might be erected if funds allow,
over the new chancel, with all the advantages of position upon
which I have already dwelt in describing the former plan.&nbsp;
Spacious vestries might be formed at the side of the new chancel,
or if preferred, below it, for which the fall of the ground and
the ascent to the chancel would give ample height.&nbsp; A very
fine effect might be obtained by ascending to the chancel in the
centre and descending on either side to the vestries below.</p>
<p>The only possible objection to this plan is one rather of
prejudice than of knowledge.&nbsp; It is thought by some persons
that it is &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; to place the holy table at the
west end of a church instead of at the east.&nbsp; Now it is a
singular fact, known to every ecclesiologist, that although from
the earliest times churches have always been built east and west,
yet the eastern position of the holy table is of late
introduction.&nbsp; The primitive arrangement, as exhibited in
the Basilicas, places the holy table almost universally at the
western end of the church, and the minister stood upon its
western side facing the congregation.&nbsp; Not only does this
arrangement prevail in St. Peter&rsquo;s, <a
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a> and in almost all the other Basilicas
at Rome, including the exceedingly early church recently brought
to light beneath the Basilica of San Clemente, but it is found
also, without I believe an exception, in the churches discovered
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>in Eastern
Syria by the Count de Vogu&egrave;, the greater portion of which
are earlier than the reign of Constantine.&nbsp; It is the
arrangement of the church of the Holy Sepulchre, and it must be
considered to be the original type adopted by the Christian
church before medi&aelig;val developments had interfered with the
primitive idea.&nbsp; A tradition of it still remains in many of
the great German churches, which have a Quire and a High Altar at
both ends of the church.&nbsp; To come nearer home, there is at
least one church in this parish built upon this plan.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to find an objection to so venerable a
tradition, but some persons, not very conversant with such
matters, have a fancy of their own, that the graves in a church
yard point toward the holy table, and upon this ground they
object to its removal westward.</p>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s consideration will show that those graves
which lie to the east of the church point away from the table,
and that those in the extreme south of the church-yard can hardly
be said to be directed towards the sanctuary, which is situated
far to the north of them.</p>
<p>The eastward direction of graves has nothing whatever to do
with the position of the chancel.&nbsp; It originated from a
belief, which prevailed in very early times, that in His second
Advent, our Lord would appear from the East, an opinion curiously
enough founded upon the text of Matthew xxiv. 27. <a
name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a>&nbsp; Whatever may be the value of this
belief the custom is venerable, and no one would wish to
interfere with it, but it has nothing whatever to do with the
position of the chancel and holy table.&nbsp; Indeed I ought to
apologise, Mr. Vicar, for taking up time in the exposure of so
obvious a blunder.</p>
<p>This plan, without the second tower, would not be more
expensive than the first one which I have described.&nbsp; It
meets the requirements of the case, provided the apse is a
<i>sine qua non</i>, exceedingly well, and would provide all the
accommodation which is really needed, without the retention of
the galleries, and at a very moderate cost.&nbsp; It has the
further advantage of retaining the present approach to the church
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>from the
east, which, both from the lie of the ground, and the position of
the chief part of our population, is the easiest and the most
natural.</p>
<p>I have now, I trust, succeeded in showing that the necessity
for destroying our Tower, and with it a great portion of the
present church, is purely imaginary.&nbsp; There are, as I have
explained, at least two methods, by which all that the Parish
desires may be provided without this sacrifice, and for the money
which the Trustees actually see their way to raise.&nbsp; I have
also explained that the luxury, for so it is, of a handsome tower
capable of holding a fine peal of bells, may very well be
obtained upon either of these plans.&nbsp; Indeed the
architectural effect of a church with two towers, as I have
suggested, would be unusually fine, and either scheme would give
a dignity to our church, beyond its real dimensions, and not
unworthy of its admirable position.&nbsp; I have only to add,
that in either case the exterior of the nave should be enriched
with a balustrade, with proper architraves to the windows, and
with pilasters between them. <a name="citation15"></a><a
href="#footnote15" class="citation">[15]</a>&nbsp; Such a
treatment would make the exterior worthy of the interior, and
would in itself raise the whole character of the building at a
very moderate expense.</p>
<p>There is yet one other suggestion which I have to make before
I conclude.</p>
<p>Should funds be available, from some unexpected source, it may
be a question whether it would not be better to erect an entirely
new church, upon a new and more convenient site.&nbsp; I should
myself incline very strongly to this view, in the case I have
supposed.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to erect a large and handsome new
church upon the site of the present one, without a most
deplorable interference with numbers of interments, many of them
of comparatively recent date.&nbsp; The site too is not
sufficiently central for the district now attached to the church,
and it would not be difficult to find one in every way more
suitable.</p>
<p>In this case the old church would remain as a very serviceable
chapel of ease.&nbsp; The galleries might be removed, the pews
cut down, <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>and proper chancel arrangements introduced at a very
small cost.&nbsp; We should thus be spared the loss of the
associations which cling about our old church, and the
convenience of an increasing population would be amply provided
for.</p>
<p>This is too much, perhaps, to hope for.&nbsp; I will only say
that such a proposal, provided only it included the preservation
of the present church, would have, I feel sure, the cordial
support of the parishioners.</p>
<p>I must apologise, Mr. Vicar, for the length to which this
letter has extended.&nbsp; I could not in a shorter space,
express fully and clearly my views upon a subject which interests
me beyond expression.&nbsp; These views are the result of more
than two years consideration of the question by one who has the
building before his eyes every day, and is one of the
congregation who worship in it.&nbsp; I am anxious beyond measure
to divert the Parish from an act of vandalism, which it has been
led to contemplate, mainly I believe from an erroneous opinion as
to the condition of the present Tower.</p>
<p>As a professional man, I assert, as I have already done, that
there are no grounds whatever for pulling down our Tower.&nbsp;
Such an act would be an outrage on good taste, and a wanton waste
of public money.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
